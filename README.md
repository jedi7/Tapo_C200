# Tapo_C200

The purpose of this repo is to make old firmware for the TP Link Tapo C200 more accessible.
All firmware is original and downloaded directly from TP Link 20231016. But dont trust me, verify the signed bins.

See, among others, the following blog and discussion on reversing/downgrading your camera: \
